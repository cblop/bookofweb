<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd01dc7b">
<p>
This week, I would like you to use your Canvas animation skills to create an animated scene of some kind. At the very least, see if you can re-create this landscape:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="sunrise.gif" alt="sunrise.gif" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Please note the things you have to implement:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a line-based shape for the mountains</li>
<li>a circle for the sun, that moves up and down and changes colour</li>
<li>a sky that dims as the sun sets</li>
<li>clouds that move back and forth behind the mountains, but in front of the sun</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is very much possible with everything you've learned so far!
</p>

<p>
If you are feeling adventurous, try adding extra features (such as cows, people, etc). If you like, you could also come up with your own completely original animated scene.
