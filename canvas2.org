* Week 24 workshop: Canvas Animation Challenge

This week, I would like you to use your Canvas animation skills to create an animated scene of some kind. At the very least, see if you can re-create this landscape:

Please note the things you have to implement:

- a line-based shape for the mountains
- a circle for the sun, that moves up and down and changes colour
- a sky that dims as the sun sets
- clouds that move back and forth behind the mountains, but in front of the sun

This is very much possible with everything you've learned so far!

If you are feeling adventurous, try adding extra features (such as cows, people, etc). If you like, you could also come up with your own completely original animated scene.
